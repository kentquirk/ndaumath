	// RateDenominator is the implied denominator for interest rates.
	//
	// EAI rates are expressed as integers, and integer math is performed
	// for determinism. However, the interest-like calculations of EAI
	// expect non-integer rates. We square this circle by treating them
	// as rationals using an implied denominator, specified here.
	//
	// RateDenominator must be tuned to preserve precision. Because of
	// technical details of EAI calculation, it cannot be greater than
	// half of a uint64: approximately 10**18. At the same time, the effective
	// precision of an EAI factor is the precision of the RateDenominator
	// reduced by the fraction of the year over which the EAI is calculated.
	//
	// One hour, as a fraction of a year, is a little more than 1/10000.
	// Therefore, by making the precision of the RateDenominator 10000 times
	// the QuantaPerUnit, we ensure that we don't lose too much precision
	// in EAI calculations. However, EAI calculations much more frequent than
	// an hour can be expected to lose some EAI to dust truncation.
